# RouterOS Agents (MikroTik)

This repo is focused on **RouterOS “agents”** (automation/control systems that run alongside MikroTik routers), like the Telegram bot project in `mikrotik-telegram-bot/`.

## Main project

- **Telegram bot for MikroTik / RouterOS scripts**: `mikrotik-telegram-bot/`
  - Start here: `mikrotik-telegram-bot/README.md`
  - Install/ops docs: `mikrotik-telegram-bot/QUICKSTART.md`

## Archived (legacy / personal scripts)

The previous one-off troubleshooting and hotspot/API helper scripts + generated reports were moved to:

- `archive/legacy-scripts/`

They’re kept for reference, but are **not** the focus of this repo going forward.
